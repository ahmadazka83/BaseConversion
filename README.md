# BaseConversion
a program that can convert input from binary/octal/decimal/hexadecimal bases to binary/octal/decimal/hexadecimal bases

in this program, I use the manual method to convert any bases.
the lack of this program is :
- the code is so messed up /jumbled hence it's kinda unreadable
- cant convert the minimum input
- only use integer. (can't use double)
- cant do any operation such as addition or subtraction

I made this for 6 days, maybe if i had a lot of time and intention, i will continue this program with a method created directly by java. so the lack of this program will be fixed
